You can find the code for this TP at the folder **cakin_ws_ubuntu** for a Linux installation or at **catkin_ws** for a Mac installation. There is no difference on the code but there is. huge difference on the dependencies. Highy recommended to create you own workspace using the official docuemntation and then create the pkgs that you wish on wich you can include the code found at wrkspc/src/pkg/scripts.
